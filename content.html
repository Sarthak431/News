    <em><h2>Titan submersible | Deep sea tragedy </h2></em>
    <h4>OceanGate, which operated the ‘Titan’ that was destroyed during its expedition to the Titanic wreckage, had been called out over the submersible’s safety standards in the past.</h4>

    <p align="justify">On June 18, contact was lost with a 6.7 metre-long submersible named ‘Titan’ which was carrying one pilot and four crew members to a depth of around 3,800 metres to see the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The U.S Coast Guard confirmed on June 22 that parts of the submersible and “debris” were found near the Titanic, and said this was consistent with a “catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber.” All those onboard have died. The U.S. Navy also confirmed evidence of an implosion or explosion near Titan’s last recorded location.</p>
    <p align="justify">Titan’s five crew members were billionaire Hamish Harding, businessman Shahzada Dawood and his university-going son Suleman Dawood, and Titanic researcher Paul-Henri Nargeolet. Piloting the submersible was Stockton Rush, the CEO of the company which operated Titan — OceanGate Inc. The tour reportedly cost $250,000.</p>
